# Honeyquest

Honeyquest is a cyber security game that asks humans to distinguish neutral, risky, and deceptive payloads.
Honeyquest presents participants with realistic web application vignettes ("queries").
Participants are asked to think like a hacker and tell us their next move.

Honeyquest can be used to evaluate what vulnerabilities and cyber traps are most attractive to attackers.

Honeyquest needs a query database to run. The query database contains the questions that are presented to the users.
Our queries are stored in the üìÇ [`./querydb`](./querydb) directory. You can also create your own queries.
Queries are just YAML files with a specific structure that is described in the üìÑ [QUERY_DATABASE](./docs/QUERY_DATABASE.md) document.
To automate the creation of queries, we also provide a few [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) jobs
which are described in the üìÑ [QUERY_CREATION](./docs/QUERY_CREATION.md) document.
Some queries are created by "patching" existing queries with our separate üìÇ [`./src/honeypatch`](./src/honeypatch) tool.
Find a bit of information about Honeypatch in the üìÑ [HONEYPATCH](./docs/HONEYPATCH.md) document.

The Honeyquest application consists of a frontend and a backend process.
The frontend is a React application that serves the user interface.
The backend is a Python application that exposes a REST API with FastAPI and does all the heavy lifting.
Our Docker container bundles both the frontend and the backend into a single container for easy deployment.

During our study we ran a human subject experiment with 47 participants,
who submitted a total of 3,669 responses to our queries (and placed 6,659 individual marks).
We dataset is freely available for further research and analysis.
The dataset and a description of it is stored in the üìÇ [`./dataset`](./dataset/README.md) directory.
Also, we provide a few Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that we used to analyze the results in the
üìÇ [`./src/honeyback/honeyquest/data/notebooks`](./src/honeyback/honeyquest/data/notebooks) directory.

## üíª Developer Guide

Planning to make changes to the source code or just want to run Honeyquest locally? Read on.

### Prerequisites

You need the following toolchain installed:

- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for the frontend app
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the backend API
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for Python dependency management
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) for the pre-commit hooks

First, install Honeyfront (frontend for Honeyquest) dependencies.

```sh
cd ./src/honeyfront
npm install
```

Then, install Honeyback (backend for Honeyquest) dependencies.
Backend dependencies are split into multiple groups:

- `main` covers everything for Honeyquest and Dagster to run
- `hooks` (optional) contains pre-commit hooks, linters, formatters, and type checkers
- `analytics` (optional) contains packages to analyze the data and create figures
- `docker` (optional) contains a process manager needed only inside the Docker container

```sh
cd ./src/honeyback
poetry shell
poetry install --with hooks,analytics
```

Then, install Honeypatch dependencies.
Note that this is a separate Poetry environment.

```sh
cd ./src/honeypatch
poetry shell
poetry install
```

Then, back in the root directory, install the pre-commit hooks.

```sh
pre-commit install
```

### Start Honeyquest

The backend exposes a REST API to serve the queries.
Don't forget to specify the folder that holds the query database.
For more options, take a look at the CLI help or head to the [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) section.
Start the backend API with the following command:

```sh
cd ./src/honeyback
poetry run honeyquest --data ../../querydb
```

The frontend serves the user interface.
During development, Vite will transparently proxy requests to `/api` to the backend REST API.
During production, an NGINX server in the Docker container will route these requests instead.
Start the frontend with the following command:

```sh
cd ./src/honeyfront
npm run dev
```

Then, navigate to üåç [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Answers from users are stored in a tempory directory that is printed to the console.
Refer to the [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) section to specify a different location.

### Start Honeypatch

Honeypatch is stand-alone tool to inject traps into arbitrary, text-based payload.
Start the program and read the help message.

```sh
cd ./src/honeypatch
poetry run honeypatch --help
```

For more usage instructions, refer to the üìÑ [HONEYPATCH.md](./docs/HONEYPATCH.md) document.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Configure the query database

The backend API needs to be told where to find the query database.
The query database contains the questions that are presented to the users.

The easiest way is to tell Honeyquest to download a `.tar.gz` compressed dataset from a public URL
and extract it on the fly with the `--data-url` argument (or the `HONEYQUEST_DATA_URL` environment variable).
The following command downloads our query database from GitHub and starts the backend:

```sh
honeyquest --data-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-oss/honeyquest/main/.github/hostedfiles/querydb.tar.gz
```

You can also pass the `--data` argument (or the `HONEYQUEST_DATA` environment variable)
to the CLI with the path to the query database. The following command uses our query database and starts the backend:

```sh
honeyquest --data ./querydb
```

If you want to create your own query database, refer to the üìÑ [QUERY_DATABASE.md](./docs/QUERY_DATABASE.md) document.

<sup>1</sup> You must set only one of `HONEYQUEST_DATA` or `HONEYQUEST_DATA_URL` to start Honeyquest, not both.

<sup>2</sup> The query database not only contains the questions but also one or more query indices.
Query indices define what questions are shown to the user, and in what order.
This argument allows to select a different index from the query database. If not set, the default index `main` is used.
If no `main` index is found, but there is only one index, that index is used. Otherwise, an error is thrown.
Refer to the üìÑ [QUERY_DATABASE.md](./docs/QUERY_DATABASE.md) document for more information.

<sup>3</sup> You should set some secret to sign the session cookies to prevent session tampering.
If you do not set this, a random token is generated on startup and printed to the console.
If you ever change this, all existing sessions will be invalidated.

<sup>4</sup> Allows users to submit the answers to the same query multiple times.
This is useful during development with only a small example dataset to test the application.
