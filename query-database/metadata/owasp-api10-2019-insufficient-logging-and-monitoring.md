###### Threat agents & attack vectors

Attackers take advantage of lack of logging and monitoring to abuse systems without
being noticed.

###### Security weakness

Without logging and monitoring, or with insufficient logging and monitoring, it is
almost impossible to track suspicious activities and respond to them in a timely
fashion.

###### Impacts

Without visibility over on-going malicious activities, attackers have plenty of time to
fully compromise systems.
