###### Threat agents & attack vectors

Old API versions are usually unpatched and are an easy way to compromise systems without
having to fight state-of-the-art security mechanisms, which might be in place to protect
the most recent API versions.

###### Security weakness

Outdated documentation makes it more difficult to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. Lack
of assets inventory and retire strategies leads to running unpatched systems, resulting
in leakage of sensitive data. Itâ€™s common to find unnecessarily exposed API hosts
because of modern concepts like microservices, which make applications easy to deploy
and independent (e.g., cloud computing, k8s).

###### Impacts

Attackers may gain access to sensitive data, or even takeover the server through old,
unpatched API versions connected to the same database.
