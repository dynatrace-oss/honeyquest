###### Threat agents & attack vectors

Exploitation requires simple API requests. No authentication is required. Multiple
concurrent requests can be performed from a single local computer or by using cloud
computing resources.

###### Security weakness

Itâ€™s common to find APIs that do not implement rate limiting or APIs where limits are
not properly set.

###### Impacts

Exploitation may lead to DoS, making the API unresponsive or even unavailable.
